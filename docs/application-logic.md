# Spamsense Application Logic

## Overview
Spamsense is a call management system that intelligently categorizes, filters, and manages incoming calls to protect users from spam while ensuring important calls are never missed.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Call Classification System

#### Call Types
- **Personal Calls**: Calls from friends, family, known contacts
- **Business Calls**: Work-related calls, professional contacts, client calls
- **Spam Calls**: Unwanted marketing, robocalls, fraud attempts

#### Call Status Flow
```
Incoming Call → Spam Detection → Classification → Action
```

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Phone number lookup in contact database
   - Cross-reference with spam database
   - Pattern matching against known spam signatures
   - Carrier information analysis

2. **Confidence Scoring**
   - 0-30: Likely legitimate call
   - 31-70: Suspicious, needs review
   - 71-100: High probability spam

3. **Automatic Actions**
   - **Allow**: Confidence < 30 AND (whitelisted OR known contact)
   - **Block**: Confidence > 70 OR blacklisted number
   - **Review**: Confidence 31-70, let user decide

### 2. Contact Management

#### Contact Intelligence
```typescript
Contact {
  phoneNumber: string,
  name?: string,
  type: "personal" | "business",
  isWhitelisted: boolean,
  isBlocked: boolean,
  callHistory: Call[],
  riskScore: number
}
```

#### Auto-Classification Logic
- **Personal Indicators**: Saved in contacts, calls outside business hours, longer call duration
- **Business Indicators**: Calls during business hours, from business numbers, shorter duration
- **Learning Algorithm**: User corrections train the system

### 3. Spam Detection Engine

#### Multi-Layer Detection
1. **Database Lookup**: Known spam numbers from community reports
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Suspicious number patterns (e.g., sequential numbers)
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Call frequency, time patterns, duration
4. **Carrier Analysis**: Spoofed numbers, VoIP indicators

#### Spam Rules Engine
```typescript
SpamRule {
  pattern: string,        // Regex pattern
  confidence: number,     // 1-100
  description: string,    // Human readable rule
  isActive: boolean      // Can be toggled on/off
}
```

#### Example Rules
- `^\+1\d{3}555\d{4}$` - Test numbers (confidence: 95)
- `^\+1\d{10}$` repeated 10+ times/day - Robocaller (confidence: 85)
- Numbers calling multiple users simultaneously - Spam campaign (confidence: 90)

### 4. User Interface Logic

#### Dashboard Sections

##### Main Stats Dashboard (`/`)
- **Call Volume**: Total calls today/week/month
- **Spam Protection**: Blocked spam calls and percentage
- **Call Distribution**: Personal vs Business breakdown
- **Top Threats**: Most blocked spam numbers

##### Personal Calls (`/personal-calls`)
- **Recent Personal Calls**: Chronological list
- **Frequent Contacts**: Most called personal numbers
- **Missed Personal**: Important calls that might need follow-up
- **Whitelist Management**: Add/remove trusted personal contacts

##### Business Calls (`/business-calls`)
- **Business Call Log**: Professional call history
- **Client Calls**: Calls from known business contacts
- **Missed Business**: Potential business opportunities
- **Business Hours Analysis**: Call patterns during work hours

##### Spam Management (`/spam-management`)
- **Blocked Calls**: Recent spam calls blocked
- **Spam Trends**: Patterns and analytics
- **Rule Management**: Custom spam detection rules
- **Reporting**: Report new spam numbers to community

### 5. AI Assistant - Mariana (`/mariana`)

#### Capabilities
- **Call Insights**: "You missed 3 important business calls"
- **Spam Analysis**: "Detected new spam pattern targeting your area code"
- **Recommendations**: "Consider whitelisting +1-555-0123 (called 5 times)"
- **Trends**: "Your spam calls increased 20% this week"

#### Natural Language Processing
- **Voice Commands**: "Block all calls from area code 555"
- **Smart Queries**: "Show me business calls from last Tuesday"
- **Contextual Help**: Understanding user intent for call management

### 6. Data Flow Architecture

#### Real-Time Processing
```
Phone Call → Carrier API → Spamsense Engine → User Interface
                ↓
    Spam Database ← Machine Learning ← User Feedback
```

#### Database Structure
```
Users
├── Contacts (personal/business classification)
├── Calls (incoming call log)
├── Rules (custom spam rules)
└── Preferences (user settings)

Global
├── SpamDatabase (community-reported numbers)
├── Patterns (ML-detected spam patterns)
└── CarrierInfo (number provider data)
```

### 7. Business Logic Rules

#### Auto-Whitelist Conditions
- Number appears in user's phone contacts
- User has called this number before
- Number has called user 3+ times with answers
- Manually approved by user

#### Auto-Block Conditions
- Number in global spam database (confidence > 80)
- Matches active spam pattern (confidence > 70)
- User has manually blocked
- Exceeds call frequency threshold (10+ calls/day)

#### Learning Algorithm
```python
def update_classification(call, user_action):
    if user_action == "allow" and call.confidence > 50:
        # User allowed a suspicious call - learn
        adjust_pattern_weights(call.phoneNumber, -10)
    
    if user_action == "block" and call.confidence < 50:
        # User blocked a trusted call - learn
        add_personal_block_rule(call.phoneNumber)
    
    retrain_model_with_feedback(call, user_action)
```

### 8. Privacy & Security

#### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive data processed on device when possible
- **Encrypted Storage**: All call logs encrypted at rest
- **Anonymous Analytics**: Spam patterns shared without personal info
- **User Control**: Complete control over data sharing preferences

#### Compliance
- **GDPR**: Right to data portability and deletion
- **CCPA**: California privacy compliance
- **TCPA**: Telephone Consumer Protection Act compliance

### 9. Integration Points

#### Phone System Integration
- **iOS CallKit**: Native call blocking and identification
- **Android Call Screening**: Google's call screening API
- **VoIP Services**: Integration with business phone systems

#### External APIs
- **Carrier APIs**: Real-time number lookup
- **Spam Databases**: TrueCaller, Hiya, community databases
- **Contact APIs**: Google Contacts, Outlook, phone contacts

### 10. Performance Requirements

#### Real-Time Constraints
- **Call Decision**: < 100ms from ring to action
- **Database Lookup**: < 50ms for number classification
- **UI Updates**: < 200ms for dashboard refresh

#### Scalability Targets
- **Users**: 1M+ concurrent users
- **Calls**: 100M+ calls processed daily
- **Database**: 1B+ phone numbers in spam database

### 11. Analytics & Reporting

#### User Analytics
- **Protection Effectiveness**: Spam calls blocked vs missed important calls
- **Usage Patterns**: Peak call times, most active contacts
- **Accuracy Metrics**: False positive/negative rates

#### Business Intelligence
- **Spam Trends**: Geographic and temporal spam patterns
- **User Behavior**: How users interact with call management features
- **System Performance**: Response times and accuracy metrics
