Design a modern, comprehensive dashboard user interface using Apple’s Liquid Glass visual style.
Core Material & Effects:
* Primary material is “liquid glass”: ultra-clear, smoothly frosted panels with deep blur, soft gradients, and dynamic, light-responsive refraction.
* All UI layers, including main panels, widgets/cards, modals, and popovers, appear as translucent, glass-like elements that subtly respond to the content behind them and the lighting of the overall screen.
* Surfaces should have nuanced depth using shadow, gentle highlights, and context-aware blur intensity (more blur for busy backgrounds, sharper for simple ones).
Structure & Layout:
* The dashboard’s content is organized into clearly separated cards/widgets for stats, graphs, notifications, activity feeds, and controls—all floating on a translucent glass base.
* Navigation sidebar and top bar use a frosted-glass look with inlaid icons and dynamic glowing accents on hover or active state.
* Use adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop, ensuring key info is always prominent and top actions remain visible on all device sizes.
Interaction & Motion:
* All UI elements animate fluidly: cards expand/retract, alerts slide out of tap points, tab bars gracefully shrink on scroll, and menus pop out from the user’s context, not full overlay.
* Buttons and inputs employ tactile feedback: glowing effect, subtle ripples, and height transitions that mimic physical glass movement.
Color & Typography:
* Glass tints are cool, neutral, or tinted by primary brand colors, with clear or “regular” glass chosen based on context (never mixed on the same screen).
* Text uses Apple’s SF Pro, always ensuring high contrast with the glass surface (enhanced by shadow or overlay if needed).
* Employ large, readable headings and widgets with iconography for quick scanability.
Information Hierarchy:
* Use clear layering: main data/widgets on thick glass, background/secondary items on thinner or more blurred glass.
* Accent important info with glowing overlays or spotlight effects—always tested for accessibility (specifically colorblind and low vision situations).
* Allow for quick switching between dashboard sections using floating glassy tab bars or chips.
Personalization & Accessibility:
* Let users toggle transparency/blur for improved accessibility as per Apple’s latest guidelines.
* Support real-time theming (light mode, dark mode, high contrast), with glassmorphism adapting accordingly.
Ambient & Context Awareness:
* Glass panels can shift lighting, color, or density based on detected content (e.g., if a video is playing behind, the card gloss and shadow intensify).
* Widgets can resize/re-prioritize organically, surfacing what’s most relevant based on recent interactions (“AI-aware” adaptivity).
